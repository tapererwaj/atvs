- This is a product website for my Automated Toilet Ventilation System.

# Product Design Situation

- Occasionally people use the toilet for major or minor purposes. Usually an unbearable odour arises afterwards which irritates or gives the person discomfort. Often people use air freshener's which deceive the sense of smell. But this does not clean the air. It only substitutes the odour with chemicals which possess a long term harmful effect to the breather. The need would be to design a system that would automatically replace the polluted air with clean fresh air after a person uses the toilet.

# Design Brief

- To design and  make a system that automatically clears out the odour in the toilet and blows in fresh air.
- The system should consume less electricity and should be cost effective.
- It should have an instant reaction time and shuts down automatically.
- However it should have an emergency shutdown switch.
- For my project I intend to use metal as the major material since it is strong, durable, ductile and malleable.

# Project Evaluation

- I really enjoyed the entire design process of my AS project. I used all the research material I found from a questionnaire and various websites to design a sturdy project. The design ideas where inspired by analysis of  existing products and mainly my mood board. Every stage in my design process played a crucial part in the final output, the working model. The working model had various electrical components which made it more effective but I intend to further develop this project as my A2 project. The estimated cost of making the model was USD $118.10 which includes the cost of some of the electric components that will be used in the final project which can lead to the assumption that the final cost of the final product will be less than USD $300.00.
